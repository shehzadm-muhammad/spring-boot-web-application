# Spring Boot Web Application – Java

A backend web application developed using **Java Spring Boot**, following a
layered **MVC architecture**. The application demonstrates core backend
development concepts including RESTful APIs, database integration, and
CRUD operations.

This project was developed as part of a university module and showcases
enterprise-style backend development using industry-standard frameworks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- RESTful API endpoints using Spring Boot
- MVC architecture (Controller, Service, Repository layers)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Database integration using Spring Data JPA
- H2 database for development and testing
- Server-side rendering using Thymeleaf
- Form handling and request validation
- Clean, maintainable project structure

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture:

- **Controller Layer**
  - Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Maps endpoints to business logic

- **Service Layer**
  - Contains core business logic
  - Acts as a bridge between controllers and repositories

- **Repository Layer**
  - Manages database operations using Spring Data JPA
  - Provides persistence and query functionality

- **Database**
  - H2 in-memory / file-based database for development

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data JPA
- Thymeleaf
- H2 Database
- Maven

---

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

The application was tested by:
- Sending HTTP requests to API endpoints
- Verifying correct CRUD behaviour
- Handling validation errors and edge cases
- Debugging common backend issues such as:
  - Database persistence behaviour
  - Request mapping errors
  - CORS configuration during development

## 📚 What I Learned

- Building backend applications using Spring Boot
- Implementing MVC architecture in practice
- Designing and testing RESTful APIs
- Working with databases and JPA repositories
- Debugging real-world backend issues
- Writing clean, maintainable Java code

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add authentication and authorisation (Spring Security)
- Integrate a modern frontend (React)
- Replace H2 with PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Add automated tests using JUnit and Mockito
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform
